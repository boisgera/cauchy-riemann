###   Is there a camera control to zoom in/out with the mouse ? 
   Have a look at cameraControls stuff. More generally, this
   is hard to move it in some direction, so initial pov (and 
   associated selection of axis to represent data) may have 
   to be selected carefully. Or, I understand the camera 
   Control stuff & design my own, without those limitations.
   Hint: the camera movement associated to some mouse mvt
   should be independent of the curren position, always
   defined as a "diff" wrt the current rotation.

   Nota: the camera angle "blocks" in some direction, this is a pain, investigate that 

   Investigate "dragpan control" (<https://github.com/jeromeetienne/tquery/issues/235>)

   Actually, look at OrbirControl in the three.js code (ex of issue desc:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18581225/orbitcontrol-or-trackballcontrol)

   Trackball control is probably what I want instead.
   (see http://benchung.com/trackball-controls-three-js/)
   And that appears to solve the "zoom" problem at the same time !

   rk: we need either some shading or some lines style otherwise,
       we can't see shit. Hence, we need to solve the inverted
       shading issue, maybe put the light somewhere else ? Or
       invert the face stuff somehow ? I'd rather not abandon
       z as the data axis :(
 

 Test: shift the grid(s) for re and im so that they dont overlap ?

# TODO : provide abs and arg ? Refactor to avoid computations somehow

Shit. Where am I supposed to clip ? In the complex fct ? In surface data ?
   That will be at the surface level for now.
  Actually, clip should be generalized to al directions and adjust automatically
   to fit the viewport domain ?
   Apply some special graphical hint where the data hits the wall ?
